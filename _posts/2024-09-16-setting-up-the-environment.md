# Step 1: Software containers

To make our analyses as portable and reproducible as possible, we work with [singularity containers](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/index.html). 

Our `scrnaseq2` singularity container includes all required software. The container is generated once, and all team members can use it on their system. 

The container version is written into the workflow output. This way, we can later go back to the same container and rely on software versions to reproduce the analysis. 

As containers are big in space, we decided to share our [DcGC singularity recipes](https://github.com/dcgc-bfx/singularity-single-cell). You can download the recipe and build the container on your own.

# Step 2: Download the scrnaseq2 code

## Option 1: Clone the scrnaseq2 repository

The easiest way to get started is to clone our scrnaseq2 repository to your local storage. 

``` bash
# Clone git
git clone git@github.com:dcgc-bfx/scrnaseq2.git
```

## Option 2: Fork the scrnaseq2 repository

If you intend to contribute to the workflow, please first create your own fork of the GitHub repository. You can then clone your own fork, work with it, and once your code is finalized and working, you can create a pull request.

# Run scrnaseq2

## Option 1: Run with RStudio

Start RStudio and associate a new project with this repository at *File* -\> *New* *Project* -\> *Existing* *Directory* and browse to the path of the git repository.

## Option 2: Run from command line
